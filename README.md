# Introduction to Continuum Mechanics 4th Edition Solutions

Hello fellow Continuum Mechanics enthusiasts! :wave: Welcome to this GitHub repository containing coding solutions to problems found in the textbook "Introduction to Continuum Mechanics 4th Edition" by Michael Lai, Erhard Krempl, and David Ruben. I have created these solutions using python and would love for you to join me in this journey of learning and exploring the fascinating world of Continuum Mechanics. :nerd_face: A theoretical solution can be found https://www.studocu.com/row/document/khalifa-university/continuum-mechanics/solutions-manual-continuum-mechanics-lai/7099919 and this repo provides the coding complementary. 

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository and navigate through the folders for each chapter. Each folder contains the LaTeX source files for the respective chapter's problem solutions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhang2wl/My-Solution-of-Introduction-to-Continuum-Mechanics-by-Michael-Lai.git
```
