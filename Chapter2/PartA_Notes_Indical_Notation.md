# Chapter 2 Part A: Indicial Notation

## Introduction

This section covers basics about 

## Basic Concepts

### Concept 1

Explain the first concept related to indicial notation. Include any relevant equations using LaTeX notation within the Markdown file. For example:

The equation for a general tensor is:

$$
T_{ij} = ...
$$

### Concept 2

Explain the second concept related to indicial notation. Include any relevant equations using LaTeX notation within the Markdown file. For example:

The equation for the Kronecker delta is:

$$
\delta_{ij} = \begin{cases}
                 1, & \text{if } i = j \\
                 0, & \text{otherwise}
               \end{cases}
$$

## Applications of Indicial Notation
